# VReddit Telegram Bot

A telegram bot which listens for video URLs and replies with the video file (including audio)

Supports v.redd.it and some other video platforms.

## Usage

To use the live bot, add [@vreddit_bot](https://t.me/vreddit_bot) to any group, or send it a private message containing a video link.

To run locally, see the **Development** section of this readme.

## TO DO

### Features:

- [x] Publish an initial working PoC and get feedback
- [x] Broadcast an "upload_video" chat action while the user is waiting
- [x] Support [inline](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inline-mode) messages
  - [x] For new videos, send first to "video cache" group to get a file ID
  - [x] 4 options for with/without caption and/or source button
- [x] Support reddit links
- [x] Add reddit post title as video caption
- [x] Include link to source as [inline keyboard](https://core.telegram.org/bots/2-0-intro#new-inline-keyboards)
- [x] Use youtube-dl to download videos so that more sites are supported
- [ ] Improve youtube-dl output message
- [ ] If v.redd.it video is > 50 mb, try to use lower quality stream
- [ ] If forwarding to the bot from a group chat, give a button to send the video back to that chat (e.g. via inline)
- [ ] Reply to /help with a short text about what the bot can do
- [ ] Stop the bot sometimes asking for location info when using inline mode
- [ ] Use streamable.com for videos between 50-500MB? (max 720p & 10min)
- [ ] /debug command which behaves as normal but enables verbose logging.
- [ ] /video command for group chats which enables the log message for that link despite it being a group
- [ ] /gif command which does video-only, and /audio which does audio-only

### Implementation details:

- [x] Set up dev tools (eslint, prettier, jest, husky, CI/CD, README)
- [x] CI: Split deploy to stage/prod into separate jobs so we can see the name in the summary.
- [x] Rename repo & npm package to vreddit-bot
- [x] Increase code coverage / add badges
- [x] Local dev server
- [x] Use async file operations & fix concurrency problems (globally unique file name?)
- [x] Try other hosting options to see if it's faster and/or cheaper:
  - [x] AWS Lambda --> was much faster & cheaper than Azure!
- [ ] Swap CI from Azure to AWS
- [ ] CI: Optimise so that we don't run checks twice on releases?
- [ ] Collect stats on inline option chosen?
- [ ] Some kind of solution for when more than 20 seconds are needed to download a file?

## Development

### Getting Started

1. Prerequisites:

   - Git
   - Node.js v14 (it must be 14 to match the version in Azure/AWS).  
      _Tip: You can install & manage multiple Node versions using tools like [nodist](https://github.com/nullivex/nodist) (Windows) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) (Linux/MacOS/WSL)_
   - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (`npm install -g yarn`)
   - Python (any version, but it must be on your `$PATH` as `python`. If it's called `python3` it won't be found by youtube-dl.)

1. `git clone` the repo and `cd` into it

1. Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following params:

   ```bash
   BOT_API_TOKEN=<your personal dev bot API token>
   BOT_ERROR_CHAT_ID=<your telegram chat ID>  # optional
   DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=300  # optional (default = no timeout)
   ```

1. Run `yarn dev` to start local dev server. You can now message your dev bot in telegram to test your code.

### Useful Commands

```sh
# Run a local bot server (configured in .env), restarts any time you save a source code file:
yarn dev

# Run all tests in watch mode:
yarn test:watch

# Auto fix lint/formatting issues (where possible):
yarn lint:fix
```

### Testing the DynamoDB video info caching

For normal development purposes video caching is disabled, since that reduces the amount of setup needed, plus it's helpful for testing to _not_ have a cache.

However, sometimes you might want to specifically test the caching logic locally.

In that case you will need:

- an AWS account
- AWS credentials saved in your `~/.aws/credentials` file (see [Loading credentials in Node.js from the shared credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/loading-node-credentials-shared.html))
- a DynamoDB table with a primary key called `url` of type `String`.

Then, add these properties to your `.env` file:

```properties
AWS_PROFILE=<(optional) credentials profile e.g. personal>
AWS_REGION=<your DynamoDB table region e.g. eu-central-1>
CACHE_TABLE_NAME=<your DynamoDB table name e.g. video-info-cache-dev>
```

Now run `yarn dev` as normal, and the cache table you specified will be used.

### Manual deployment to staging

1. Create a new file `.env.staging`, with the following content:

```properties
AWS_PROFILE=<(optional) credentials profile e.g. personal-account>
AWS_REGION=eu-central-1
CACHE_TABLE_NAME=video-info-cache-staging

BOT_API_TOKEN=<staging bot API token>
BOT_ERROR_CHAT_ID=<your telegram chat id>

SAM_ENV=staging
```

2. Install the AWS SAM CLI
3. Run `yarn deploy`
4. If needed, update the webook URL by running `npx env-cmd -f .env.staging set-webhook <URL>`

### CI/CD

1. Open a **pull request** to run linting & tests
1. Push to the **master branch** (e.g. merge a PR) to deploy to **staging** ([@staging_vreddit_bot](https://t.me/staging_vreddit_bot))
1. Create a tag by running **`yarn release`** to deploy to **prod** ([@vreddit_bot](https://t.me/vreddit_bot))

```

```
